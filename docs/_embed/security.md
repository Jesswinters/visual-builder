# Security

Our user's security is paramount. By default, we deny any embedding of our product unless you provide us with a list of domains that you expect to embed Zapier in. This protects the user from malicious activities like [Clickjacking](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Clickjacking). An example of what the user would see if you were to attempt to embed Zapier and the embedding domain was not registered with us:

**NOTE:** the App Directory and Zap Template Elements are exempt from this as users are required to log in to their Zapier account after clicking on a Zap Template link.

To provide us a list of unique domains you'll embed Zapier in:

- if you've already embedded our Product, you're in luck! We should have already captured this and have permitted your product domains. Should we have missed any, please [reach out to us](mailto:partners@zapier.com) so we can add your domain.
- else if you've already applied for a Partner API access: contact [partners@zapier.com](mailto:partners@zapier.com) and include the domains you'd like to register.
- otherwise, when you [apply for the Partner API access](https://zapier.typeform.com/to/atnWuF) you'll have the opportunity to supply us the embedding domains inside of the form.
